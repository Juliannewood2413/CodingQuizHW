# CodingQuizHW
The objective of this assignment was to create a quiz app that would store user data in local storage
I began the assignment by thinking about what elements a user would interact with first, i.e. a start quiz
   button, and an end page
We also needed to create a score counter and decrement time if the user answered a question incorrectly, 
  in this case, I chose to take away 15 seconds for each incorrect
This assignment was difficult, and required use of all the skills learned in the past few weeks, as well as 
  some that I had to research while completing
Overall, I was able to create a quiz and solidify information that was slightly unclear prior to the assignment.
